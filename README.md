* [Sending API Request](daksha_know-how/ApiRequest.md)
* [Writing Test Case](daksha_know-how/CreateTest.md)

## Building and Running

### Using docker

  - Take a look at [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file and create all the necessary [environment variables](#environment-variables).

  - Run the command `docker-compose up -d` to initiate the build and deploy the project.
  
  - NOTE: If you're running the application through docker and intend to run scripts saved locally, make sure to mount the location of test yamls to the container so that test yamls could be accessed from inside of container.

### Local deployment (without docker)

  - Create a virtual environment using python 3.7
  - Install all requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Create any env variables needed
  - Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the project
